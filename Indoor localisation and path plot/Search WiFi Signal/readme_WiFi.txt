AIM Of the Project

To Find the available WiFi signals nearby and get
their signal strengths and distances

COMPONENTS Required

1.Node MCU(ESP 8266)
2.WiFi router

WORKING

#ESP 8266 in NodeMCU module can detect the wifi signals of nearby 
devices and return the RSSI value
#The RSSI values were then converted to distances by taking constants 
from known distances and values

RESULT

The obtained results taken from the Serial moniter of the arduino IDE
